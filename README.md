# opensource-automobile-system-design

An open source initiative to assist in the design the system for various classes of automobiles 

# Impact:
The automobile engineering inputs are made available to entrepreneurs and hobbyists worldwide so that 
1. Their models are engineered well with the best global standards and costly mistakes are avoided
2. Their time-to-market gets drastically reduced
3. Prices of automobiles get reduced for there would be many manufacturers.
4. Worldwide innovation can be utilized through community engagement

## The process:

1. The usser input parameters are processed to generate the suggestions. 
2. The selected options in the suggestions are re-processed for detailed specifications. 
3. These detailed specifications can be helpful in validating for prototyping

# Electric vehicles

## User's inputs could be: 

1. Type of vehicle
2. The number of wheels
3. Dimensions of the body
4. Weight that needs to carried
5. The number of seats

## Design choices for the following components are our major focus:

1.	Frame (Chassis)
2.	Motor
3.	Motor controller
4.	BMS (Battery Management System) + Batteries
5.	Braking system
6.	Lidar + sensors
7.	Cabling (CAN bus)
8.	Suspension system (Front & Rear)
9.	Shock absorption
10.	Steering
11.	Lighting
12.	Body - Dome and Internals + seats
13.	Wheels, rims, and tires (15â€²)
14.	Battery Charger + interface
15.	Safety & security (Airbags + alerts)
